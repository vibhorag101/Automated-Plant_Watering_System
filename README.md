# An Automated Plant Watering System
An Automated Plant Watering System using Arduino Uno R3, Ultrasonic and
Soil Humidity Sensor.It turns on the water pump automatically once the soil humidity
dips below a certain threshold. It also provides the users information like soil humidity
and bucket water level on a LCD.

## Hardware Needed üõ†Ô∏è
- Arduino Uno R3
- HC-SR04 Sensor
- 5V 4 Channel Relay
- Jumper Wire
- LCD1602 Parallel LCD Display
- 16X2 I2C Module for LCD.
- Laser Transmitter Module For Arduino
-  SG90 9G MICRO SERVO MOTOR
- Breadboard
- 3.5-5.5V Standard Active Buzzer Module
- Water Pump
- 5V Adapter and AC Supply for Pump.

## Pin Setting üìå
- A0 is set as the soil sensor Analog Pin in Input Mode
- Digital Pin 6 is set as trigger pin for Ultrasonic Sensor
- Digital Pin 7 is set as echo recieving pin for Ultrasonic Sensor
- Digital Pin 10 is set as Relay Pin to control relay and thus water pump
- Digital Pin 11 is set as the Buzzer Pin

## Steps to Deploy the project üíª
- Clone the repository
- Install Arduino IDE and setup the environment.
- Now connect your Arduino Uno R3 to PC and flash to it using Arduino IDE

## To-Do and Bug-Fixes‚úÖ
The following mentioned features need improvement
- Implement a solution for auto reservoir filling. Currently Manual
- Buzzer not working properly
- Need an automatic humidity calibration system.
